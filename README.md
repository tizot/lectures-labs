## Table of contents

The course covers the basics of Deep Learning, with a focus on applications:

  - Neural Networks and Backpropagation ([slides](https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs/slides/01_intro_to_deep_learning/index.html))
  - Embeddings and Recommender Systems ([slides](https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs/slides/02_recommender_systems/index.html))
  - Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification ([slides](https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs/slides/03_conv_nets/index.html))
  - Deep Learning for Object Dection and Image Segmentation ([slides](https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs/slides/04_conv_nets_2/index.html))
  - Recurrent Neural Networks and NLP ([slides](https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs/slides/05_deep_nlp/index.html))
  - Expressivity, Optimization and Generalization

The jupyter notebooks for the labs can be found in the `labs` folder of
